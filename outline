- quick overview of ARC, strong/weak references.
- blocks & closures, including the "strong-weak dance" that is
sometimes required.
- techniques to write memory from multiple threads.
- GCD.
- queues and dispatch_async.
- for examples, NSTimer and NSURLConnection, maybe also
addObserverForName since that requires special handling to avoid a
retain cycle.
